🧠 LeetCode Solutions in C

A collection of my solutions to LeetCode problems, implemented in C. This repository serves as a personal laboratory for learning data structures, algorithms, and code optimization for both time and memory efficiency.

🚀 Project Structure

Each solution is organized into separate folders or individual main.c files.

Dante Folder: Contains solutions for the "Dante" system (https://dante.iis.p.lodz.pl/) used during my university studies. Dante is an automated testing platform for C programming, very similar in nature to LeetCode.

Language: C (Standard C11/C99)
